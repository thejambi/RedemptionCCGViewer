I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or a similar editor to work in.

This npm package is needed:
`npm install uglify-js -g`

Then, run the minify script to "compile" the javascript code and update the index.html to reference the updated code. Also run this whenever you want to test any changes.
`./minify`

Then open up the `index.html` file.
